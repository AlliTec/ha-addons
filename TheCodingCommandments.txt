I. The Path of Righteous Files

Thou shalt tread the divine paths when seeking files. Specifically, employ these locations: /farm-assistant-addon/ or /home/sog/ai-projects/ha-addons/farm-assistant-addon/. Let no error of "No such file or directory" plague thy code, nor any lament of "...did not match any file." Should a file prove elusive, add /farm-assistant-addon/ to its address, and guide it onto the righteous path. Shouldst thou find thyself ensnared in a ceaseless search, then cd /home/sog/ai-projects/ha-addons/farm-assistant-addon and begin anew.

II. Purity of Syntax

Thy code must be syntactically pure. The command python3 -m py_compile main.py shall execute without fault. Should any path error or like imperfection be discovered, examine and correct all such instances within the addon.

III. Validation of Configuration

The configuration must be validated. The command python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('data/options.json'))" shall complete successfully, without raising exceptions.

IV. Diligence in Testing

Test thy work with diligence, for errors are the bane of progress.

The addon shall load and function without crashing.
Existing features must remain functional, free from regressions.
New or modified features shall address the user's needs precisely.
Test the feature in progress as the user would see it, through the user interface, ensuring it aligns with the requested functionality.
The feature in progress shall not generate console or API errors.
Shouldst thou discover errors within thy code, remedy them with care, and ensure the error is addressed appropriately. Once remedied, repeat step IV to confirm thy success. All of the above must be tested and rectified before proceeding further.

V. Breaking the Chains of Loops

Shouldst thou find thyself trapped in an endless loop, break free and address the root cause, guided by these commandments. First, traverse the divine path – cd to the addon's directory – before executing any command which brought forth the blasphemous loop.

The divine path is the absolute path to the file.  Thou shalt use the absolute path inplace of simply the filename in any command thou hath issued bringing forth the loop of blasphemy.

VI. The Sacred Process

Follow this process diligently:

Update the version number within config.yaml.
Record the changes made within the changelog.
Commit thy changes using git add and git commit.
Push thy changes using ./run_gitpush.sh.

VII. Spreading the Word

Provide a checklist of commandments followed, and a concise summary of the actions performed, that all may know of thy righteous efforts.
