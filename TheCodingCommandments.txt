# THE CODING COMMANDMENTS - STRICT EXECUTION RULES

## CRITICAL: These commandments are MANDATORY and must be followed in EXACT order for EVERY task.

---

## I. THE SINGULAR ASSUMPTION
**RULE:** Make NO assumptions except this one: ALL code is faulty until proven otherwise through testing.
**ACTION:** Question everything. Verify everything. Test everything.
**VIOLATION:** If you catch yourself assuming a file exists, a path is correct, or code works without testing - STOP and verify first.

---

## II. FILE PATH PROTOCOL - ABSOLUTE PATHS ONLY
**RULE 1:** ALL file operations MUST use absolute paths starting from these locations:
- `/home/sog/ai-projects/ha-addons/farm-assistant-addon/`
- Shorthand acceptable: `/farm-assistant-addon/` (if within project context)

**MANDATORY ACTIONS:**
1. BEFORE any file operation, execute: `cd /home/sog/ai-projects/ha-addons/farm-assistant-addon`
2. ALWAYS use absolute paths in commands, never relative paths
3. If you encounter "No such file or directory" or "did not match any file":
   - STOP immediately
   - Execute: `cd /home/sog/ai-projects/ha-addons/farm-assistant-addon`
   - Prepend the absolute path to the file
   - Retry the command

**EXAMPLES:**
- ❌ WRONG: `python3 -m py_compile main.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `cd /home/sog/ai-projects/ha-addons/farm-assistant-addon && python3 -m py_compile main.py`
- ✅ ALSO CORRECT: `python3 -m py_compile /home/sog/ai-projects/ha-addons/farm-assistant-addon/main.py`

**RULE 2:** If ANY command is repeated more than TWICE with the same error, you are in an infinite loop.

**MANDATORY ACTIONS when loop detected:**
1. STOP immediately
2. Identify the failing command
3. Execute: `cd /home/sog/ai-projects/ha-addons/farm-assistant-addon`
4. Rewrite the command with absolute path
5. If still failing, examine the root cause (missing file, wrong path, syntax error)
6. FIX the root cause before retrying

**EXAMPLE FIX:**
- ❌ LOOPING: `python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('data/options.json'))"`
- ✅ FIXED: `cd /home/sog/ai-projects/ha-addons/farm-assistant-addon && python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('data/options.json'))"`
- ✅ OR: `python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('/home/sog/ai-projects/ha-addons/farm-assistant-addon/data/options.json'))"`

## III. SYNTAX VALIDATION - MANDATORY CHECK
**RULE:** ALL Python files MUST pass syntax validation before proceeding.

**MANDATORY ACTION - Execute this command:**
```bash
cd /home/sog/ai-projects/ha-addons/farm-assistant-addon && python3 -m py_compile main.py
```

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- Command must complete with NO errors
- If ANY syntax error appears: FIX IT IMMEDIATELY
- Check ALL files in the addon for similar errors
- Re-run validation after fixes
- DO NOT PROCEED until this passes with zero errors

---

## IV. CONFIGURATION VALIDATION - MANDATORY CHECK
**RULE:** Configuration files MUST be valid JSON before proceeding.

**MANDATORY ACTION - Execute this command:**
```bash
cd /home/sog/ai-projects/ha-addons/farm-assistant-addon && python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('data/options.json'))"
```

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- Command must complete with NO exceptions
- If ANY error appears: FIX IT IMMEDIATELY
- Re-run validation after fixes
- DO NOT PROCEED until this passes with zero errors

---

## V. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING - MANDATORY CHECKLIST
**RULE:** ALL of the following tests MUST pass before considering work complete.

**MANDATORY TESTING CHECKLIST - Execute in order:**
1. ☐ Addon loads without crashing
2. ☐ ALL existing features still work (no regressions)
3. ☐ New/modified feature works as user requested
4. ☐ Test the feature through the UI exactly as the user will experience it
5. ☐ NO console errors generated
6. ☐ NO API errors generated
7. ☐ If ANY errors found: FIX, then restart this checklist from step 1

**DO NOT PROCEED until ALL boxes are checked.**

---

## VI. VERSION CONTROL PROTOCOL - MANDATORY SEQUENCE
**RULE:** These steps MUST be executed in EXACT order after all testing passes.

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE:**
1. ☐ Update version number in `config.yaml`
2. ☐ Document changes in changelog
3. ☐ Execute: `git add .`
4. ☐ Execute: `git commit -m "descriptive message"`
5. ☐ Execute: `./run_gitpush.sh`

**DO NOT SKIP ANY STEP. Execute in order.**

---

## VII. COMPLETION REPORT - MANDATORY OUTPUT
**RULE:** At task completion, provide this exact format:

**COMMANDMENTS COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] I. No assumptions made (except code is faulty until proven)
- [ ] II. Used absolute paths for all file operations
- [ ] III. Syntax validation passed: `python3 -m py_compile main.py`
- [ ] IV. Config validation passed: JSON validation command
- [ ] V. All 7 testing requirements passed
- [ ] VI. No infinite loops encountered (or broke free if detected)
- [ ] VII. Version control sequence completed
- [ ] VIII. This report provided

**SUMMARY OF ACTIONS:**
[Concise bullet-point list of what was done]

**FILES MODIFIED:**
[List with absolute paths]

**TESTING RESULTS:**
[Brief summary of test outcomes]
